Description:

This is a circular audio visualizer, built using HTML5 Canvas.

If you want to learn how I built it, I'll be doing a tutorial on my [blog](https://thecybermonkeys.com).

Note: I don't own the wallpaper or the music

The music is from [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
From [cementcity-1](https://soundcloud.com/cementcity-1/undertale-cement-city-remix)

The rain music is completely mine.
